## Redis Connection Management Improvements

1. **Connection Pool Implementation**
   - Replace the singleton Redis client with a properly managed connection pool
   - Reduce minimum connections from 15 to 3 for startup efficiency
   - Increase maximum connections to 50 for high-throughput scenarios
   - Configure pool parameters via environment variables (REDIS_POOL_MIN, REDIS_POOL_MAX)

2. **Socket.IO Redis Adapter Integration**
   - Ensure Socket.IO cluster support with proper Redis adapter configuration
   - Fix compatibility issues between Socket.IO and ioredis library

3. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Add Redis pool metrics for connection usage tracking
   - Add API endpoint for monitoring pool health (/redis-pool-stats)
   - Log connection pool statistics for better operational visibility

4. **Improved Stability**
   - Add graceful shutdown to properly close Redis connections
   - Implement health checking with automatic connection recovery
   - Validate connections to ensure they're working properly

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain existing API through proxy mechanism
   - Support existing key migration patterns
   - Fix redundant connection logs
